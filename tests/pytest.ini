[pytest]
; For running async tests as seen from https://stackoverflow.com/a/72104554
asyncio_mode = auto

; directories containing tests
testpaths =
    tests

; force pattern for test content
python_files = test_*.py
python_functions = test_*
python_classes = Test*

pythonpath =
    tests/withrepo

; equivalent to pass the argument to pytest CLI
addopts =
    ; increase verbosity
    --verbose
    ; do not capture output
    --capture=no
